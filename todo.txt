-- TODO --

Tackle these first

- split into short stay/long stay carparks
- auto refresh (or refresh button)
- auto sort by the most amount of spaces available
- create thresholds for each car park so the thresholds are percentage based not strict values 
    (this is now done - will test)

Nice to haves

- Geofencing for nearest carpark
- Twitter integration (when carpark is full)?
